### INTRODUCTION
One of the main causes of the majority of traffic accidents is fatigue. Sleep deprivation endangers motorists' safety and can occasionally result in serious injuries that are deadly or create significant financial losses. When driving, drowsiness is associated with feeling lethargic, losing focus, and having sleepy eyes. The majority of accidents in India are caused by drivers who are not paying enough attention. Due to sleepiness, the driver's performance gradually declines. We created a system that can identify the driver's level of tiredness and promptly warn him in order to prevent this abnormality. Through the use of a camera, this system records images as a video stream, locates the eyes, and recognizes faces. Next, a Deep CNN model is used to analyze the eyes for signs of sleepiness. An alarm system warns the driver of potential sleepiness based on the outcome.
Our team has developed a way to stop these kinds of mishaps. This system records the user's visual attributes using a camera. We attempt to detect the driver's tiredness using face detection and CNN algorithms; if successful, an alarm will sound. in order for the motorist to become more watchful and take precautions. The number of fatal traffic accidents has decreased in part because of the detection of driver drowsiness.
